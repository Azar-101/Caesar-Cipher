# Caesar Cipher

## Description
This is a Python program that implements the Caesar Cipher algorithm. The Caesar Cipher is a simple substitution cipher where each letter in the plaintext is shifted a certain number of places down or up the alphabet. This program allows users to:

- Encrypt messages by providing a shift value.
- Decrypt messages using the same shift value.

## Features
- Supports both uppercase and lowercase letters.
- Keeps non-alphabetic characters (e.g., spaces, punctuation) unchanged.
- User-friendly menu for encryption and decryption.

## Usage
### Input
1. **Choose an option**: Encrypt or Decrypt.
2. **Enter your message**: Input the text to be processed.
3. **Enter the shift value**: Specify the number of positions to shift each letter.

### Output
The program outputs the encrypted or decrypted message based on the user's choice.

## Code Example
Here's how the program works:
```python
Enter your message: Hello World
Enter the shift value: 3
Result: Khoor Zruog```
